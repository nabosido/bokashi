git init -->

ls -a -> all things

GitHub is just storage (like iCloud for documents) -- separate from git

commit is basically saving a snapshot --> but only of things we tell git to track

git add
  stage files: changes that want to eventually commit (but haven't committed yet)

if you don't commit yet, still added, even if change contents not "modified"

put a message next to commit, to know what change--so include commit message in command (-m)

git commit -am
  -a adds (rather than doing git add in separate step)

  - make commits early and often -- avoid committing super large files
  - use git status frequently
